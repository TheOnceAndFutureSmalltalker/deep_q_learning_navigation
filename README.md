# Deep Q Learning Navigation
These are the deliverables for Navigation for Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Nanodegree.
The code in this project uses a neural network and deep q learning to find Q value function for an agent trying to navigate a world of yellow and blue bananas.  The goal is to pick up as many yellow bananas as possible while not picking up any blue bananas.

## Deliverable Files

File | Description
------------ | -------------
Navigation.ipynb | Jupyter notebook of runnable code that trains the agent 
Navigation.html | HTML version of Jupyter notebook
checkpoint.pth | Saved weights of Q-Learning neural network

## Instructions

Currently, this repository does not contain all required dependencies, support files, and instructions for actually running the notebook.  This to come later.
