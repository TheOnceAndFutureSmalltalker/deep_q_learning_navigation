# Deep Q Learning Navigation
These are the deliverables for Navigation for Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Nanodegree.
The code in this project uses a neural network and Deep Q Learning to find Q value function for an agent trying to navigate a world of yellow and blue bananas.  The goal is to pick up as many yellow bananas as possible while not picking up any blue bananas.

## Deliverable Files

File | Description
------------ | -------------
checkpoint.pth | Saved weights of Q-Learning neural network.
Navigation.ipynb | Jupyter notebook of runnable code that trains the agent.
report.md | A discussion of the project and the results.


## Dependencies

To run this code, you must have Python 3.6, Jupyter, PyTorch, NumPy, and Matplotlib installed.  You must also have the 

## Instructions

Load the Jupyter Notebook file Navigation.ipynb and execute each cell in succession.  The last cell is the model training and may take several minutes to complete.
